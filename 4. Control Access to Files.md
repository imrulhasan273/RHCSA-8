# **File Permission**

---

- UNIX is a multi-user system. 

- Permissions for file or directory may be restricted to/by types.

**3 Types of permissions**

1. r - read
2. w - write
3. x - execute = running a program = or for a directory to `cd`


**Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at three levels.**

1. u - user = yourself
2. g - group = can be people in the same project
3. o - other = everyone in the system

**File or Directory permission can be displayed by running** 

```sh
ls -l   # displaying permissions of files or dirs
# -rwxrwxrws    - file
# drwxrwxrws    - dir
```

**Command to change permission**

```sh
chmod g-w file  # remove write permission from the group (g)
chmod a-r file  # remove read permission from all (a)
chmod u-w file  # remove write permission from the user (u)
chmod u+rw file # Add read and write permission for the user (u)
chmod g+rw file # Add read and write permission for the group (g)
