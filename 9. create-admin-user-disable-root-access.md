# Steps to Create a New Admin User and Disable Root Access

## Add a New User
   - Create a new user by running:
     ```
     adduser newadmin
     ```
     Replace `newadmin` with your desired username.

   - Set a password for the new user:
     ```
     passwd newadmin
     ```

## Grant Administrative Privileges
   - Add the new user to the wheel group (on most Linux distributions, the wheel group allows sudo access):
     ```
     usermod -aG wheel newadmin
     ```

   - Verify the user has sudo privileges by switching to the new user:
     ```
     su - newadmin
     sudo ls /root
     ```
     If this works without errors, the new user has the required privileges.

## Test the New Userâ€™s Access
   - Open a new terminal or SSH session.
   - Log in as the new user to ensure you can perform administrative tasks using `sudo`.

## Disable Root Login
   - Open the SSH configuration file:
     ```
     vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```

   - Look for the following lines:
     ```
     PermitRootLogin yes
     ```
     Change `yes` to `no`:
     ```
     PermitRootLogin no
     ```

   - Save and close the file.

   - Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
     ```
     systemctl restart sshd
     ```


## Tips for Enhanced Security:
- Use SSH Key-Based Authentication:
   - For the new admin user, configure SSH key-based authentication to avoid using passwords altogether.

- Change the Default SSH Port:
   - Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and change the port number:
     ```
     Port 2222
     ```
   - Restart SSH:
     ```
     systemctl restart sshd
     ```

- Install Fail2Ban:
   - To prevent brute-force attacks, install and configure Fail2Ban:
     ```
     sudo dnf install epel-release -y
     sudo dnf install fail2ban -y
     ```
- Enable and Start the Fail2Ban Service
    ```
    sudo systemctl start fail2ban
    sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
    ```

- Configure Fail2Ban

To configure Fail2Ban for specific services, you need to create a local configuration file:
    
- Copy the Default Configuration File:

    ```
    sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    ```
- Edit the Configuration: Open the jail.local file for editing:

```
vi nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

- Modify SSH Settings (Example): Locate the [sshd] section and ensure the following settings:

```
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
logpath = /var/log/secure
maxretry = 5
bantime = 10m
```

1. enabled = true: Enables monitoring for SSH.
2. maxretry: Number of failed login attempts before banning.
3. bantime: Duration of the ban (e.g., 10m = 10 minutes).

> Save and Close: Save the file and exit (CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X).

- Restart Fail2Ban

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
    ```
- Verify Fail2Ban is Running

```
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
```

## Testing the Setup:
- Ensure the new user can log in and execute `sudo` commands.
- Verify that root login is disabled by attempting to log in as root.
