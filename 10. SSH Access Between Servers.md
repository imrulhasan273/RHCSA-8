## Step 1: Generate SSH Keys on the Master

### Log in to the master server as a user (e.g., root or another administrative user)

```
ssh <your-master-server-IP>
```

### Generate an SSH key pair:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

- Press Enter when prompted for a file name (default: ~/.ssh/id_rsa).
- Leave the passphrase blank (just press Enter).

This generates:
- Private key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
- Public key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

## 2. Copy the Public Key to the Slave Server

### Use the ssh-copy-id command to copy the master server's public key to the slave server:

```
ssh-copy-id <user>@<slave-server-IP>
```

Replace <user> with the slave server's user (e.g., root) and <slave-server-IP> with the slave's IP address.

### Enter the slave server's password when prompted. This adds the master server's public key to the slave server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

## 3. Test SSH Access

### From the master server, attempt to SSH into the slave server:

```
ssh <user>@<slave-server-IP>
```

> If successful, it should log in without prompting for a password.

## 4. Optional: Restrict SSH Access for Security

On the slave server, restrict SSH access to only the master server:

### Edit the SSH configuration file:

```
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### Add or modify the following:

```
AllowUsers <user>@<master-server-IP>
```

### Restart the SSH service:

```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

## 6. Firewall Configuration

Ensure SSH traffic (port 22) is allowed between both servers:

### Check and open the SSH port:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=22/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Verify the firewall settings:

```
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```
